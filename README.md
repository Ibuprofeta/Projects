# 1. Occupational Therapy Restaurant

## Description

Cooking mini-game produced for a occupational therapy degree team of the University of Vic. The therapy team offered the idea and the theme they wanted for a game focused on people suffering from ADHD, which we developed during one of the subjects of the degree.
The mini-game is based on running the kitchen of a restaurant, cooking and building the different recipes with the food and the order in which they are ordered, with the aim of challenging and improving various aspects of the player's attention.
The design and artwork of the assets was done by a teammate of the project team, the rest of the minigame was developed individually.
Made in *Unity*.

# 2. Memory World of Warcraft

## Description

Mobile application produced for a 3rd grade project. 
The game is based on the classic Memory, a memory game where two players have to discover pairs of identical elements, which remain hidden. In each turn, two pieces are uncovered, hidden later if they do not make a pair. The objective of the game is to uncover more pairs than the opponent. It also contains a single player mode which competes against a very basic AI.
The theme of the game is from the famous MMO-RPG World of Warcraft.
Made in *iOS (Swift, Xcode)*.

# 4. DBD Slot Machine

## Description

Slot Machine mini-game for a streamer.
It is a minigame that contains all the characters and skills of the DBD game and randomizes them. The minigame allows you to select the different characters and skills depending on whether or not you have them available in the game. This project was requested by a streamer who wanted a small application to randomize the skills he had to use in each game to make his content more interesting. We are currently working on finishing the visual polishing of the application. 
Made in *Unity*.

# 5. 3D Eastern Oriental Scenery

## Description

3D scene with animations for a 2nd year university project.
A 3D environment was designed and created  with its animations. Of course, each of the components added in the scene was also designed, modeled and animated. In my case, I was inspired by the Eastern Oriental theme with elements such as the japanese typical trees or the Chinese type boats.
Made in *Blender*.

# 6. Elven Ruins

## Description

3D platform game made for a last year university project.

This project consists of a prototype of a 1st person 3D platformer videogame using Ureal Engine 4. The premise of this project was to get to know how UE4 works in order to expand our knowledge within the videogame industry. The main point of it was to learn and practise with the UE4 environment so, to be more efficient, we picked up free assets from the Unreal Engine Marketplace.
This prototype was carried out in cooperation with a university colleague. He was centered on programming and implementing few mechanics of the game, both gameplay as well as menu and UI mechanics. Meanwhile, I was working with the design and modeling of several levels, focused on the more artistic side of the project.
